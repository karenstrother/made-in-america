              The new Made in America initiative is the result of a Presidential Executive Order signed January 25, 2021.  The Executive Order created the Office of Management and Budget’s Made in America Office, established a requirement for agencies to submit proposed waivers to the Made in America Office for review, and directed public transparency through this new website.  <a class="text-base-lightest" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/ " targe="_blank">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/</a> OMB subsequently issued guidance on <a class="text-base-lightest" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/M-21-26.pdf">how to implement the Made in America E.O.</a> Regulatory actions related to this E.O. are publicly available at

               With $600 billion in annual procurement spending, almost half of which is in manufactured products, from helicopter blades to trucks to medicine, the U.S. Government is a major buyer in a number of markets for goods and services, including the single largest purchaser of consumer goods in the world. Ensuring clear, consistent, and transparent implementation of Buy American policies will help the U.S. Government leverage its purchasing power more effectively to advance the competitiveness of U.S. industries.

               Strengthening Made in America policies will send clear market signals to give suppliers confidence that manufacturing in the U.S., with America’s workers, will provide greater opportunities.  Ensuring that Made in America laws are implemented clearly and consistently across the whole government will help support domestic suppliers in the <a class="text-base-lightest" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">six critical supply chains</a> identified by President Biden.

              Are Buy America and Buy American the same?
            </button>
          </h3>

               No. What’s the difference? The Buy American Act (BAA) is the primary law that requires the Federal government to prefer domestic goods and manufactured products when making purchasing decisions. The BAA and implementing regulations in the <a class="text-base-lightest" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Acquisition Regulation</a> (FAR) provide a two-part test for determining if a product qualifies as a domestic end product: (i) the item must be manufactured in the United States, and (ii) more than 55 percent of the cost of all the component parts must be manufactured in the United States. The FAR provides various waivers and exceptions to the BAA. By contrast, Buy America Laws are applicable to Federal Financial Assistance (such as grants), not procurement.  There is no single “Buy America” statute.  Rather, there are a number of statutes that require those receiving Federal assistance to prefer goods, products, and materials made in the United States. For example, the Federal Transit Administration’s grant-making authority requires that the steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States.

              I heard that 55 percent is no longer the threshold to determine if a product qualifies under the Buy American rules. Is this true?
            </button>

          <div id="faq-8" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose bg-primary-darker text-base-lightest">
            <p>
               The 55 percent threshold is currently in effect, but on July, 30, 2021, the FAR Council proposed to increase the content threshold requirement immediately to 60 percent, and to further raise it to 75 percent over the next several years.  Increasing the content thresholds is intended to strengthen the government’s commitment to American manufacturing and make Buy American real.  If adopted, the higher thresholds will take effect in accordance with timeframes set forth in the final rule.

               The creation of the Made in America Office is a first of its kind, historic effort to provide consistency and transparency to Made in America waivers across the whole of government.  The process takes time to implement.  As the MIAO expands its work, you will see the information on this site expand.  Please visit again soon.
